# Sensor System Project - README

## Project Overview

In this **CS 281 - Introduction to Systems** lab, I developed a sensor system using Arduino that detects object distance and provides feedback through a beeping sound. The project demonstrates how to integrate hardware and software to create a functional system that reacts based on proximity using a distance sensor.

## Objectives

- **Distance Detection**: Measure the distance of an object using a sensor connected to an Arduino.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Create a beeping sound that changes frequency depending on the object's proximity.
- **Arduino Integration**: Use Arduino to process sensor data and control the output.

## Components

1. **Arduino Microcontroller**: Manages the input from the sensor and controls the beeping mechanism.
2. **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**: Measures the distance to an object and sends data to the Arduino.
3. **Buzzer/Speaker**: Produces a beeping sound, where the frequency varies based on the detected distance.
4. **Wiring and Breadboard**: Connects all the components for the system's operation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Feedback**: The beep frequency increases as the object approaches the sensor, providing real-time proximity feedback.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The Arduino continuously monitors distance and adjusts the beeping sound accordingly.

## Implementation

1. **Arduino Setup**: 
   - The distance sensor is connected to the Arduino and continuously measures distance.
   - The Arduino processes the distance data and calculates the appropriate beep frequency based on proximity.

2. **Beeping Mechanism**:
   - A buzzer is controlled by the Arduino, with the frequency of the sound increasing as the object gets closer.
   - The system continuously adjusts the frequency of the beep in real time.

3. **Sensor Calibration**:
   - The ultrasonic sensor is calibrated to detect objects within a certain range to ensure accurate proximity readings.
   
4. **Code**:
   - The Arduino sketch reads the sensor input, computes the distance, and adjusts the delay between beeps accordingly.
   - Sample code (in C++) handles reading the sensor and triggering the beep sound with the correct frequency.

## Usage

1. **Power the System**: Connect the Arduino to a power source (via USB or external power supply).
2. **Place Object in Front of Sensor**: As an object moves closer to the sensor, the beep frequency will increase.
3. **Adjustments**: Test different distances to observe the change in the beeping sound in response to object proximity.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building a sensor-based system with Arduino. I learned how to interface an ultrasonic sensor with a microcontroller and provide dynamic, real-time feedback through sound. The project reinforced concepts of hardware integration, sensor calibration, and real-time systems processing.
